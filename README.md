 Researchers have confirmed the close connection between the development of arm muscles and the development of speech and thinking. A high level of formation of fine motor skills of the fingers provides a sufficient level of memory and attention. Fine motor skills of the hands are associated with the development of the temporal and left frontal areas of the brain, which are responsible for the formation of many mental functions. the creation of a simulator will expand the range of devices for the development of hand motor skills. In addition to the simulator, there should be a mobile application that allows you to visualize statistical data and subsequently diagnose them and issue recommendations to the user. This application in the C# programming language is mobile and implemented with the help of the Ksamarin platform SDK, and at the moment it is a trial uniting the main aspects of the project.
